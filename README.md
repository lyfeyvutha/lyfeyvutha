## About Me

AI Engineer with a **B.Sc. in Computer Science (Magna Cum Laude)** from [Fort Hays State University (FHSU)](https://www.fhsu.edu/), specializing in **machine learning**, **deep learning**, and **natural language processing (NLP)**. My passion lies in developing innovative AI solutions that address real-world challenges.
